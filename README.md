## Introduction
This project is based on 
[vue-element-admin](https://panjiachen.github.io/vue-element-admin) which is a production-ready front-end solution for admin interfaces. It is based on [vue](https://github.com/vuejs/vue) and uses the UI Toolkit [element-ui](https://github.com/ElemeFE/element).

[vue-element-admin](https://panjiachen.github.io/vue-element-admin) is based on the newest development stack of vue and it has a built-in i18n solution, typical templates for enterprise applications, and lots of awesome features. It helps you build large and complex Single-Page Applications. I believe whatever your needs are, this project will help you.
